Some of my findings on what containers share with the host:

- Containers has their own filesystem, but it can also access to the host filesystem if we mount them into the container.
For example, I need to mount Docker socket file in my machine (host) to allow golang-service (service2) running in the container connect to Docker daemon.

- Each container has its own networking configuration, but it can also connect to the host network, or be part of customized networking.
In this exercise, both services live under the same (non-host) network, and only node-service (service1) can be exposed to the host.
